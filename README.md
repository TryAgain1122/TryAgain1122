## Hi there! I'm Rafhael Fernando F. Luis ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a self-taught web developer specializing in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), and I'm passionate about building scalable and efficient web applications. Currently in my final year at AMA University, pursuing a BS in Information Technology.

I love creating dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly websites, with a strong focus on clean code and software quality. My main tech stack includes JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS, Redux, and Next.js, but Iâ€™m always exploring new technologies and improving my skills.

ðŸŒ± Currently learning: Docker, Kubernetes, and enhancing my expertise in cloud computing and DevOps practices.<br/>
ðŸ’¼ Looking to contribute: Open to collaborating on exciting projects, particularly those that involve modern web technologies and solving real-world challenges.<br/>
